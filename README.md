# bamazon

Bamazon is my Week 13 homework assignment for the UC Berekely Coding Boot Camp. It is an application created from a backend database using MySQL, as well as Node.js. The application is used to display the current stock listed items as customers view and pull items from the store inventory. The application also adds more items to the database as the items are restocked.
